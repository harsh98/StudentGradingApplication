# StudentGradingApplication
This Student Grades Application allows the user to perform various different tasks to and from the registrar.accdb database. It allows users to import students from the new_enrolment.dat file into the database. It allows users to import grades from the new_grades.dat file into the database. With a click of a button, the user can view the class average based on final grades. Shows the different courses being offered. Allows the user to enter new students. Lastly, it displays data for all the students in the database including their final grade. I chose to develop this application because it allows me to expand my knowledge on queries and databases. I wanted to give myself a challenge by developing an application that is not only functional to a high-level but also looks good aesthetically.
